# Abstract


# Introduction

It is common practice in the life sciences to use three replicates (`n=3`) when conducting an experiment. When reporting uncertainty, it is also common practice to compute a 95% Confidence Interval, or to compute the Standard Error of Measurement (SEM), based on the data collected. When sample sizes are not taken for granted to be `n=3`, sample size determination is often done by computing statistical power, but this frequently requires expert estimation of expected effect sizes, differences, or parameter values, as is the case with clinical trials [@Rohrig:2010ca]. Underlying these common practice is a "frequentist" viewpoint, in which the frequency of an event is related to its probability [@Vanderplas:2014uc].

In this paper, I seek to explore how an experimenter may adaptively decide the number of experimental measurements to make using a Bayesian framework. Here, I consider only the case of inter-comparison of a sample with a control, which is the most common biological experimental setup.
